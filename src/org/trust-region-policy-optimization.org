When using policy gradients, small changes in the parameter space can sometimes have very large differences in performance. This makes it dangerous to use large step sizes as a single bad step can collapse policy performance. TRPO introduces a method for updating the policy while satisfying a constraint that measures how similar new and old policies are allowed to be.
