Practicing linear algebra problems with Julia. Also thinking about how I'm going to structure my thesis. How do I organize a study of generalizations of neural networks across a number of different architectures and tasks? How can we apply neuron group selection to a number of different architectures? How can we train networks without gradient descent?
