More reading about echo state networks. From what I can tell, ESNs outperform small artificial neural networks of comparable sizes. They perform really well for lower dimensional tasks. These include time series and simple reinforcement learning. They have not been shown to outperform really deep networks like state of the art CNNs on high dimensional tasks like image processing.
