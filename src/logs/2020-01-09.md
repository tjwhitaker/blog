Rereading some papersto get reaquainted with the project. Read next generation genetic algorithms and nk ensemble networks. I'm really excited about applying partition crossover to reservoirs. I think right now, the nk project doesn't actually use partition crossover, but I think it could be an interesting addition in the future. Not only can we select the best grouping of neurons for any given task, we can also evolve the configurations of the neurons as well as perform this neuron group selection.
