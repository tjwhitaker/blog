Hello everyone. Welcome to my new website! I love to code and write and I built this to showcase some of the cool things I'm working on.

Here's a little about me.

I was born in 1992 in Pensacola, Florida. We moved around a lot when I was a kid. My dad was a pilot in the navy and every 3-5 years we were dropping everything and moving to a new city. 

I found stability and community in internet forums and video games. That kindled an interest in computer programming and artificial intelligence for as long as I can remember.
