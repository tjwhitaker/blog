What's up everyone. This is my first post for Take Prophet. I'm excited to write some articles for you on machine learning and trading.

I'm a programmer by trade. I started graduate school this year to pursue a career in machine learning research. While I've been trading on and off for a while, it wasn't until I got into machine learning that I found a renewed interest in trading. It's the perfect sandbox for somebody with a passion for programming, mathematical models, and big data.
