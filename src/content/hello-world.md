Welcome to my new website! I'm a machine learning researcher at Colorado State University, advised by Darrell Whitley and Chuck Anderson. I built this to share some of the cool research I'm reading and the cool projects I'm working on.

I hope you find some helpful articles here! Feel free to reach out to mail(at)timwhitaker.ai if you want to get in touch.
