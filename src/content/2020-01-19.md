Cleaned up code in nnet2nk.cpp for the nkrc project. Added line breaks, spaces, and indentation to make the code more readable. I started refactoring as well but ended up reverting those changes. I think it's best to fully understand the current system before I go changing it. I added comments to every functional block of code in nnet2nk.cpp.
