Happy new year and welcome to my new blog! The past few weeks have been a whirlwind of family, celebration and adventure as Alyssa and I drove almost 5000 miles to California and back. I proposed to her in one of the most important places in the world to us and she said yes! I've known for a long time that I was going to marry her, and now that the excitement has simmered down, it's funny how normal it all seems. I couldn't be more confident to marry the woman that I love, respect and believe in more than anything else in the world, and that's why I think it feels so right.
