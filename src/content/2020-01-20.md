Continued work on formatting. Got through the entire echo state class today. Also started profiling performance of the first algorithm with valgrind. Seeing a lot of computation spent on matrix multiplication and related functions. If we want to speed our code up and enable gpu acceleration, I think these functions are a good place to start.
