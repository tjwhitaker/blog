Learning about reservoir computing architectures. The two main flavors are echo state networks and liquid state machines. They both include reservoirs of sparsely connected recurrent neurons. The difference between ESNs and LSMs are in the activation of the neurons. ESNs are like any other standard ANN neuron. LSMs use spiking neurons, they only fire when their aggregate inputs sum up to a value greater than rome threshold.
