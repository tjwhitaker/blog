## Intro

Today I'm going to be going over a special type of function that shows up in evolutionary programming literature called the k-bounded pseudo-boolean function.

## Background

Pseudo-boolean functions are a class of functions that map a sequence of binary digits (0 or 1) to a real number.

```math
  f : \{0, 1\}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}
```

K-bounded pseudo-boolean functions are pseudo-boolean functions which can be expressed as a sum of subfunctions which each depend on `` k `` bits.

```math
  f(x) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^m f_i(x)
```
