I'm starting my work as a graduate researcher in machine learning next month. I've never had a research position before, so naturally I'm very excited and a little nervous.

We're going to be doing research on machine learning models inspired by a theory of brain function called Neural Darwinism. This theory was published in 1978 by a nobel prize winning biologist named Gerald Edelman. He hypothesizes that the brain develops as the result of evolutionary selectionist processes on neuronal groups. His work lays out three key ideas:

1. The topology of the neural network changes epigenetically during development through a selective process called differential reproduction. 

2. Once the topology of the brain is established, connection strengths between neurons are modified by behavioral experiences through a process called differential amplification.

3. Reentrant signaling is a process of communication between neural groups and allows for spatiotemporal continuity in response to real time events and is proposed to be necessary for generating and maintaining conscious states.
